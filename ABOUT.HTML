    <h1>ANIME WORLD</h1>
    <p>
        anime (Japanese: アニメ, IPA: [aɲime] (About this soundlisten)) is hand-drawn and computer animation originating
        from Japan. In Japan and in Japanese, anime (a term derived from the English word animation) describes all
        animated works, regardless of style or origin. However, outside of Japan and in English, anime is colloquial for
        Japanese animation and refers specifically to animation produced in Japan.[1] Animation produced outside of
        Japan with similar style to Japanese animation is referred to as anime-influenced animation.

        The earliest commercial Japanese animations date to 1917. A characteristic art style emerged in the 1960s with
        the works of cartoonist Osamu Tezuka and spread in following decades, developing a large domestic audience.
        Anime is distributed theatrically, through television broadcasts, directly to home media, and over the Internet.
        In addition to original works, anime are often adaptations of Japanese comics (manga), light novels, or video
        games. It is classified into numerous genres targeting various broad and niche audiences.

        Anime is a diverse medium with distinctive production methods that have adapted in response to emergent
        technologies. It combines graphic art, characterization, cinematography, and other forms of imaginative and
        individualistic techniques.[2] Compared to Western animation, anime production generally focuses less on
        movement, and more on the detail of settings and use of "camera effects", such as panning, zooming, and angle
        shots.[2] Diverse art styles are used, and character proportions and features can be quite varied, with a common
        characteristic feature being large and emotive eyes.[3]

        The anime industry consists of over 430 production companies, including major studios like Studio Ghibli,
        Sunrise, and Toei Animation. Since the 1980s, the medium has also seen international success with the rise of
        foreign dubbed and subtitled programming. As of 2016, Japanese anime accounted for 60% of the world's animated
        television shows.[4]

    <h2 style="font-family: 'Tourney', cursive;"><b>NARUTO</b></h2>
    <P>
        Naruto (Japanese: NARUTOナルト) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto. It tells
        the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks recognition from his peers and dreams of becoming the
        Hokage, the leader of his village. The story is told in two parts – the first set in Naruto's pre-teen years,
        and the second in his teens. The series is based on two one-shot manga by Kishimoto: Karakuri (1995), which
        earned Kishimoto an honorable mention in Shueisha's monthly Hop Step Award the following year, and Naruto
        (1997).

        Naruto was serialized in Shueisha's magazine, Weekly Shōnen Jump from 1999 to 2014, and released in tankōbon
        (book) form in 72 volumes. The manga was adapted into an anime television series produced by Pierrot and
        Aniplex, which broadcast 220 episodes in Japan from 2002 to 2007; the English dub of the series aired on Cartoon
        Network and YTV from 2005 to 2009. Naruto: Shippuden, a sequel to the original series, premiered in Japan in
        2007, and ended in 2017, after 500 episodes. The English dub was broadcast on Disney XD from 2009 to 2011,
        airing the first 98 episodes, and then switched over to Adult Swim's Toonami programming block in January 2014,
        starting over from the first episode. The English dub is still airing weekly on Adult Swim to this day. Besides
        the anime series, Pierrot has developed eleven movies and twelve original video animations (OVAs). Other
        Naruto-related merchandise includes light novels, video games, and trading cards developed by several companies.

        Viz Media licensed the manga and anime for North American production and serialized Naruto in their digital
        Weekly Shonen Jump magazine. The anime series began airing in the United States and Canada in 2005, and in the
        United Kingdom and Australia in 2006 and 2007, respectively. The films and most OVAs from the series were also
        released by Viz, with the first film premiering in movie theaters. Viz Media began streaming the two anime
        series on their streaming service Neon Alley in December 2012. The story of Naruto continues with Naruto's son,
        Boruto Uzumaki, in Boruto: Naruto Next Generations: Boruto wishes to create his own ninja way instead of
        following his father's.

        Naruto is the fourth best-selling manga series in history, selling 250 million copies worldwide in 46 countries,
        with 153 million of the sales in Japan alone and remaining 97 million copies elsewhere. It has become one of Viz
        Media's best-selling manga series; their English translations of the volumes have appeared on USA Today and The
        New York Times bestseller list several times, and the seventh volume won a Quill Award in 2006. Reviewers
        praised the manga's character development, strong storylines, and well-executed fight scenes, though some felt
        the fight scenes slowed the story down. Critics noted that the manga, which has a coming-of-age theme, makes use
        of cultural references from Japanese mythology and Confucianism.

        A powerful fox known as the Nine-Tails attacks Konoha, the hidden leaf village in the Land of Fire, one of the
        Five Great Shinobi Countries in the Ninja World. In response, the leader of Konoha and the Fourth Hokage, Minato
        Namikaze (with his wife Kushina Uzumaki) seals the fox inside the body of his newborn son, Naruto Uzumaki,
        making Naruto a host of the beast;[i] this costs Naruto's father his life, and the Third Hokage returns from
        retirement to become the leader of Konoha again. Naruto is often scorned by Konoha's villagers for being the
        host of the Nine-Tails. Due to a decree by the Third Hokage forbidding any mention of these events, Naruto
        learns nothing about the Nine-Tails until 12 years later, when Mizuki, a renegade ninja, reveals the truth to
        Naruto. Naruto then defeats Mizuki in combat, earning the respect of his teacher, Iruka Umino.[ii]

        Shortly afterward, Naruto becomes a ninja and joins with Sasuke Uchiha, against whom he often competes, and
        Sakura Haruno, on whom he has a crush, to form Team 7, under an experienced sensei, the elite ninja Kakashi
        Hatake. Like all the ninja teams from every village, Team 7 completes missions requested by the villagers,
        ranging from doing chores and being bodyguards to performing assassinations.

        After several missions, including a major one in the Land of Waves, Kakashi allows Team 7 to take a ninja exam,
        enabling them to advance to a higher rank and take on more difficult missions, known as Chunin Exams. During the
        exams, Orochimaru, a wanted criminal, invades Konoha and kills the Third Hokage for revenge. Jiraiya, one of the
        three legendary ninjas, declines the title of Fifth Hokage and searches with Naruto for Tsunade whom he chooses
        to become Fifth Hokage instead.

        During the search, it is revealed that Orochimaru wishes to train Sasuke because of his powerful genetic
        heritage, the Sharingan. [iii] After Sasuke attempts and fails to kill his older brother Itachi[iv], who had
        showed up in Konoha to kidnap Naruto, he joins Orochimaru, hoping to gain from him the strength needed to kill
        Itachi. The story takes a turn when Sasuke leaves the village: Tsunade sends a group of ninja, including Naruto,
        to retrieve Sasuke, but Naruto is unable to persuade or force him to come back. Naruto and Sakura do not give up
        on Sasuke: Naruto leaves Konoha to receive training from Jiraiya to prepare himself for the next time he
        encounters Sasuke, while Sakura becomes Tsunade's apprentice.
